== Reserve Funds ==

User -> BFF: POST /payments
note right
  {
    "walletId": "uuid",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "RUB"
  }
end note

BFF -> Wallet: POST /wallets/{walletId}/reservations
note right
  {
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "RUB"
  }
end note
Wallet -> WalletDB: write transaction (RESERVED)\n+ outbox (PaymentInitiated)
Wallet --> BFF: paymentId

BFF --> User: 202 Accepted
note right
  {
    "paymentId": "uuid",
    "status": "RESERVED"
  }
end note

== Publish Event (CDC) ==

KC -> WalletDB: read WAL
KC -> Kafka: PaymentInitiated

== Process Payment ==

Kafka -> Transaction: PaymentInitiated
Transaction -> TxDB: write payment (PROCESSING)
Transaction -> Provider: POST /payments
note right
  {
    "paymentId": "uuid",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "RUB"
  }
end note
Provider --> Transaction: 202 Accepted
note right
  {
    "providerTxnId": "uuid",
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
end note
Transaction -> TxDB: save providerTxnId, status=PROCESSING

== Provider Callback (FAILURE) ==

note over Transaction, Provider
  Timeout scenario: if no callback within N minutes,
  Transaction Service scheduler creates PaymentFailed event
end note

Provider -> Gateway: POST /callbacks
Gateway -> Callback: POST /callbacks
note right
  {
    "providerTxnId": "uuid",
    "status": "FAILED",
    "errorCode": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
  }
end note
Callback -> CallbackDB: save callback + outbox (ProviderCallbackReceived)
KC -> CallbackDB: read WAL
KC -> Kafka: ProviderCallbackReceived
Kafka -> Transaction: ProviderCallbackReceived
Transaction -> TxDB: update (FAILED)\n+ outbox (PaymentFailed)

== Publish Failure (CDC) ==

KC -> TxDB: read WAL
KC -> Kafka: PaymentFailed

== Compensate: Release Funds ==

Kafka -> Wallet: PaymentFailed
Wallet -> WalletDB: release reserved funds (FAILED)

== Update Read Model ==

Kafka -> Query: PaymentFailed
Query -> QueryDB: update projection
